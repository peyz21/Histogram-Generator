# Histogram-Generator
This one page website uses pure HTML, JavaScript and CSS along side of Java SpringBoot and  Railway.app to display a use case of deploy working with railway along side of the java Spring Boot for backend scripting.

and after adding the bounds it should display the distribution of the grades in each bound cathegory in its histogram. I tried to focus on the visualization aspects along side with the error handling and simple Validations.
